 * inherit from this class and implement their specific behavior.
 *
 * The Dialog class provides:
 * - Modal and non-modal display modes
 * - Modal state management
 *
 * @note This is an abstract base class. Use specific dialog types like
 * MessageDialog, FileDialog, etc., to create actual dialogs.
 *
 * @example
 * ```cpp
 * // Create a message dialog (see MessageDialog for details)
 * auto message_dialog = std::make_shared<MessageDialog>(
 *     "Title", "Message", MessageDialogType::Info);
 *
 * // Set modal mode and open
 * message_dialog->SetModality(DialogModality::Application);
 * message_dialog->Open();
 * ```

   * - Application: Blocks interaction with all windows in the current application
   * - Window: Blocks interaction with a specific parent window (requires parent handle)
   *
   * @param modality The modality type to set
   *
   * @note This setting affects the behavior when Open() is called.
   *       The modality should be set before opening the dialog.

   * @example
   * ```cpp
   * dialog->SetModality(DialogModality::Application);  // Make it application modal
   * dialog->Open();                                    // Open as modal dialog

   * - Application/Window: Opens modally, blocks until the user dismisses the dialog
   *
   * @return true if the dialog was successfully opened, false otherwise
