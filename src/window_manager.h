/**
 * @brief WindowManager is a singleton that manages all windows in the application
 *
 * The WindowManager provides a centralized interface for creating, managing, and
 * monitoring windows across the entire application. It follows the singleton pattern
 * to ensure there's only one instance managing all windows, and provides event
 * notifications for various window state changes.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Singleton pattern ensures single point of window management
 * - Event-driven architecture for window state notifications
 * - Cross-platform window creation and management
 * - Thread-safe access to the singleton instance
 * - Automatic cleanup of resources on destruction
 *
 * @note This class is thread-safe for singleton access, but individual operations
 *       may require additional synchronization depending on the platform implementation.
